 * Express.js (JavaScript web application framework)
 * MongoDB (document-oriented NoSQL database)
 * Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js)

We would also like to express our appreciation to the ALX mentors for their support and inspiration. Our app would not have been possible without their collective knowledge and expertise. Thank you!
